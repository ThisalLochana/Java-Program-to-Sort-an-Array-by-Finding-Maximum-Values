# Java Program to Sort an Array by Finding Maximum Values
 This Java program sorts an array of integers by repeatedly finding the maximum value and swapping it with the last unsorted element. The program prints the maximum value found in each iteration and the length of the unsorted portion of the array. Finally, it prints the sorted array.
